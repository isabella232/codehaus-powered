The web is increasingly becoming visually oriented, progressing from text to photos and other rich media. Close to 10 million new photos are uploaded on a daily basis, a number which is doubling every eight to ten months. Photos tell many stories, but unlike text, the context of a photo is hard to search for unless explicitly "translated" by a human being. The photo web of today is like the text web before Altavista, Inktomi, and Google. Polar Rose makes photos searchable by analyzing their content and recognizing the people in them.
